
In JavaScript, the comma operator is used to evaluate multiple expressions in a single statement. 
It allows you to combine expressions into a single expression, and the result of the entire expression is the value of the rightmost expression.

for example,
let x = 1;

x = (x++, x);

console.log(x);
// Expected output: 2

x = (2, 3);

console.log(x);
// Expected output: 3
