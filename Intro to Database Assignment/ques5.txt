
Database Management Systems (DBMS) can be broadly classified into two main categories: 
Relational DBMS (RDBMS) and Non-Relational DBMS (or NoSQL databases).

1. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):

Data Model: Organizes data into tables with rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each column 
represents a field or attribute. The relationships between tables are established using keys.

Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.

Characteristics:

Follows the principles of the relational model proposed by E.F. Codd.
Uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data.
Ensures data integrity through constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.
Supports ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to guarantee data reliability in transactions.

Use Cases:
Suitable for applications with well-defined and structured data requirements.
Commonly used in business applications, financial systems, and applications where data consistency is critical.

2. Non-Relational Database Management System (NoSQL):
Data Model: NoSQL databases use various data models such as document-oriented, key-value pairs, column-family, 
and graph databases. The choice of model depends on the specific requirements of the application.

Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB, Neo4j etc.

Characteristics:
Designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data efficiently.
Provides flexibility in data modeling, allowing developers to adapt to changing requirements.
Often designed for horizontal scalability, making it easier to scale out by adding more servers.

Use Cases:
Ideal for scenarios where the data structure is dynamic or evolves rapidly.
Suited for applications with large amounts of data or distributed data across multiple servers.
Commonly used in web applications, real-time analytics, and scenarios where scalability and flexibility are crucial.
