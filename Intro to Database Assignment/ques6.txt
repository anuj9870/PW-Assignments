Data Modeling in software engineering is the process of simplifying the diagram or data model of a software system by
 applying certain formal techniques. It involves expressing data and information through text and symbols. The data 
 model provides the blueprint for building a new database or reengineering legacy applications.

Data Modeling is the process of creating data models by which data associations and constraints are described and 
eventually coded to reuse. It conceptually represents data with diagrams, symbols, or text to visualize the interrelation. 

Data Modeling thus helps to increase consistency in naming, rules, semantics, and security. This, in turn, improves 
data analytics. The emphasis is on the need for availability and organization of data, independent of the manner of 
its application.

Types of Data Modelling:
1. Conceptual Model : It is a visual representation of database concepts and the relationships between them 
identifying the high-level user view of data. Rather than the details of the database itself, it focuses on 
establishing entities, characteristics of an entity, and relationships between them. 

2. Logical Model : This model further defines the structure of the data entities and their relationships. Usually, a 
logical data model is used for a specific project since the purpose is to develop a technical map of rules and data 
structures.

3. Physical Model : This is a schema or framework defining how data is physically stored in a database. It is used for 
database-specific modeling where the columns include exact types and attributes. A physical model designs the internal 
schema. The purpose is the actual implementation of the database.
