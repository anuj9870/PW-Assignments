A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, 
management, and manipulation of information. Databases are designed to store large amounts of data systematically, 
making it easier to organize, update, and retrieve information when needed. Databases typically use a specific data 
model, such as relational, document-oriented, graph-based, etc., and are managed by database management systems (DBMS) 
that provide the necessary tools to interact with the data.

for example, consider an online retail store that needs to manage a vast amount of information, including customer data,
product details, inventory levels, order history, and more. Without a database, this information could be scattered
across various files, spreadsheets, or even stored in memory during the application's runtime. In this scenario database
is crucial as it provieds following features:

1. Data organization and integrity,
2. Data Retrieva and querying,
3. Concurrency and multiple user access,
4. Scalability,
5. Security,
6. Data Maintainance and Backup.
