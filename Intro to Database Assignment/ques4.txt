File-based storage systems, while simple, come with several challenges that Database Management Systems (DBMS) aim to
 address. Here are five challenges and how DBMS tackles them:

Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:
In file-based systems, data redundancy is common, leading to inconsistencies. Multiple copies of the same 
data may be stored in different files, making it challenging to maintain accuracy and consistency.
DBMS provides normalization techniques, enforcing rules to reduce redundancy and maintain data integrity. 
Relationships between tables help prevent anomalies, ensuring consistency in the database.

Limited Query Capabilities:
File-based systems lack a standardized querying language, making it difficult to perform complex queries or efficiently 
retrieve specific information.
DBMS, particularly relational databases, introduces SQL (Structured Query Language), a powerful and standardized 
language for querying and manipulating data. This allows users to express complex queries for data retrieval and 
analysis.

Concurrency and Data Access Issues:
In a file-based system, handling concurrent data access by multiple users or applications can lead to conflicts, 
data corruption, and inconsistency.
DBMS implements concurrency control mechanisms, such as locks and transactions, to manage access to data. This ensures 
that multiple users can interact with the database simultaneously without compromising data integrity.

Scalability Challenges:
As data grows, file-based systems may struggle to scale, leading to performance issues and increased complexity in 
managing a growing dataset.
DBMS systems are designed to scale horizontally or vertically, accommodating increasing data volumes and user demands. 
They provide mechanisms for efficient data storage, indexing, and retrieval to handle large datasets.

Data Security and Access Control:
File-based systems lack built-in security measures, making it challenging to control access to sensitive 
data. Data may be vulnerable to unauthorized access or tampering.
DBMS incorporates robust security features, including authentication, authorization, and encryption. Access control 
mechanisms are implemented to restrict user access to specific data based on roles and permissions, ensuring data 
security.
