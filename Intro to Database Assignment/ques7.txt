
The Three Schema Architecture is a conceptual framework that separates a database system into three abstraction layers:
the user or view schema, the logical schema, and the physical schema. This architecture was introduced by the database
pioneer E.F. Codd. Here's an explanation of each schema and their advantages:

Advantages of the Three Schema Architecture:

Data Independence:
The architecture provides a clear separation between user views, logical structure, and physical implementation. This 
separation allows for changes at one level without affecting the other, providing data independence.

Flexibility and Adaptability:
Users can have tailored views, developers work with a standardized logical schema, and administrators can optimize the 
physical storage. This flexibility enhances adaptability to evolving requirements.

Security and Access Control:
The user schema allows for the creation of different views for different user groups, providing a mechanism for 
implementing security and access control policies.

Easier Maintenance and Development:
With clear distinctions between views, logical structure, and physical implementation, maintenance and development 
tasks become more manageable, promoting a modular and organized approach.

Optimized Performance:
The physical schema allows for optimizations at the storage and access level, contributing to better performance. 
This is crucial for large-scale and performance-critical database systems.
