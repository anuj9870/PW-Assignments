A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software application that provides an interface to interact with databases. 
It facilitates the creation, management, and manipulation of databases, allowing users and applications to store, 
retrieve, and manage data efficiently. DBMS acts as an intermediary between the database and the end-users or 
applications, providing a structured and organized approach to handling data.

Need of DBMS:
The need for a Database Management System arises from several challenges associated with managing large volumes of data. Here are key reasons why DBMS is essential:

->Data Organization:
DBMS provides a systematic and structured way to organize data. It allows the creation of tables, relationships, 
and constraints, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

->Efficient Data Retrieval:
DBMS supports powerful query languages (like SQL) that enable users to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently. 
This is especially crucial as datasets grow in size and complexity.

->Data Integrity and Security:
DBMS ensures data integrity by enforcing constraints, such as unique keys and foreign keys, to maintain accurate and 
consistent information.

->Scalability:
As data volumes increase, DBMS systems can scale to handle the growing dataset and increased demand for data storage 
and retrieval.

->Data Maintenance:
DBMS facilitates easy maintenance of data through operations like insertion, deletion, and modification. This 
simplifies the task of updating and managing data over time.

->Reduction of Data Redundancy:
DBMS helps minimize data redundancy by storing data in a centralized location and establishing relationships between 
tables, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.

->Data Modeling:
DBMS supports data modeling, allowing users to design the database schema and relationships between entities, which is 
crucial for effective representation and management of data.
