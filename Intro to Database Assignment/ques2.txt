A file-based storage system is a method of organizing and storing data in individual files on a computer or
storage device. In this system, data is typically stored in a hierarchical structure, where directories 
contain files and files may, in turn, contain data or information. Each file is a discrete unit that holds specific
information, and the organization is often based on the user or application and needs.


Despite their simplicity, file-based storage systems face a significant challenge: the absence of structured querying
capabilities. Unlike relational databases that use SQL to query and manipulate data in a structured manner, file-based 
systems lack a standardized querying language. This limitation makes it challenging to perform complex queries, 
especially when dealing with large datasets or when intricate data relationships need to be navigated.
In a file-based system, finding specific information can be akin to searching through an old-style filing cabinetâ€“
efficient for basic retrieval but cumbersome when dealing with intricate data relationships. Without the ability to 
perform advanced queries, tasks such as filtering, sorting, and aggregating data become less intuitive and more 
time-consuming.

As technology advances and data complexity increases, the challenge of structured querying becomes more pronounced.
While file-based systems remain valuable for certain use cases due to their simplicity and ease of use, addressing the 
querying limitations is crucial for meeting the demands of modern data management.
